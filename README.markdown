﻿Sundown
=======

`Sundown` is a Markdown parser based on the original code of [libsoldout](https://fossil.instinctive.eu/) by Natacha Porté.

Features
--------

*	**Massive extension support**

	`Sundown` has optional support for several (unofficial) Markdown extensions,
	such as non-strict emphasis, fenced code blocks, tables, autolinks,
	strikethrough and more.

*	**UTF-8 aware**

	`Sundown` is fully UTF-8 aware, both when parsing the source document and when
	generating the resulting (X)HTML code.

*	**Customizable renderers**

	`Sundown` is not stuck with XHTML output: the Markdown parser of the library
	is decoupled from the renderer, so it's trivial to extend the library with
	custom renderers. A fully functional (X)HTML renderer is included.

*	**Zero-dependency**

	`Sundown` is a zero-dependency library composed of 3 `.c` files and their headers.
	No dependencies, no bullshit. Only standard C99 that builds everywhere.

Help us
-------

`Sundown` is all about security. If you find a (potential) security vulnerability in the
library, or a way to make it crash through malicious input, please report it to us,
either directly via email or by opening an Issue on GitHub, and help make the web safer
for everybody.

Unicode character handling
--------------------------

Given that the Markdown spec makes no provision for Unicode character handling, `Sundown`
takes a conservative approach towards deciding which extended characters trigger Markdown
features:

*	Punctuation characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not handled as punctuation.
	They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.

*	Whitespace characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not considered as
	whitespace. They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.

Install
-------

There is nothing to install. `Sundown` is composed of 3 `.c` files (`markdown.c`,
`buffer.c` and `array.c`), so just throw them in your project. Zero-dependency means
zero-dependency. You might want to include `render/html.c` if you want to use the
included XHTML renderer, or write your own renderer. Either way, it's all fun and joy.

If you are hardcore, you can use the included `Makefile` to build `Sundown` into a dynamic
library, or to build the sample `sundown` executable, which is just a commandline
Markdown to XHTML parser. (If gcc gives you grief about `-fPIC`, e.g. with MinGW, try
`make MFLAGS=` instead of just `make`.)
